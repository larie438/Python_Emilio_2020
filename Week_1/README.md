This calculator can perform 5 operations: additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and powers.
Start by choosing one of the five operations > press Enter > input the first number > press Enter > input second number>
press Enter > decide if you want to run the program again.
if/elif statements are used to select the correct mathematical operation.
To make the user able to run the program as many times as they desire without the need to reload it
2 functions need to be create calculator() and again()
I tried to use try...except to warn the users if they were dividing by zero but couldn't really figure it out

Thanks, Lisa Tagliaferri, for the excellent tutorial
