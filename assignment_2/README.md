Python_Emilio_2020
I initially wanted to keep going with assigmnet 1, coding blink detection and controlling and arduino with it but it was definetly out of my leage.
I recently got into Crypto so I decided to create a piece of code to scrape crypto prices from the web.
Unfortunatly they must have changed something with the API I'm using to prevent free users to access history data breaking my code. I'm currently in the procces to debugging it and fix it.
